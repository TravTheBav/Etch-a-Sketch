#Using html/css/JS to make a responsive Etch-a-Sketch!

In this project I used css/flexbox to make the Etch-a-Sketch look like a real life Etch-a-Sketch that responds to screen re-sizing. I also used JavaScript to make each "pixel" within the Etch-a-Sketch screen responsive so that when it is clicked it changes color.
