An Etch-a-Sketch made with html, CSS, and JavaScript!

Hover your mouse over the Etch-a-Sketch grid to start drawing.
When you want to clear the grid or change the grid size, just press
the 'clear' button.

Use shading mode to darken the pixels or rainbow mode for some interesting effects!

Have fun!
